# Linked List

Looking for a new job is hard. When you are sending out dozens of applications, it can be difficult to keep track of the process. Linked List helps you manage your job search, with its unique dashboard, dedicated to collecting all the relevant information you need about each company you apply to.

The app pulls essential information and important news for each company by using Bing's API.
